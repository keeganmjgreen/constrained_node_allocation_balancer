# Constrained Node Allocation Balancer

## Getting started

Assuming you are using a Linux-based OS:

1. Install Poetry: `curl https://install.python-poetry.org | python3`
2. `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project false`
3. Create the project's virtual environment (based on `pyproject.toml`): `poetry install`

Assuming you are using VS Code:

4. Add `"python.venvPath": "~/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/"` to your **user** `settings.json`.
5. Select `constrained-node-allocation-balancer-<hash>-<python-version>` as your Python interpreter.
