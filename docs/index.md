# Constrained Node Allocation Balancer

The constrained node allocation balancer is an algorithm designed for tree data structures in which:

- Each leaf node is given an allocation (some value or amount).
- Each parent node's allocation is equal to the sum of its child nodes' allocations.
- Nodes are constrained by a limit on their maximum allocation.

The algorithm distributes, or balances, the allocations among the leaf nodes as evenly as possible given the aforementioned constraint.
